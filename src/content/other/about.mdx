I bridge the gap between technical logic and digital storytelling. Currently balancing Java & Web Development with high-level account management for US-based brands.

When I’m not building systems or optimizing Meta/GHL ecosystems, I’m immersed in story-driven gaming-exploring the worlds of Ghost of Tsushima, God of War, and Resident Evil.
